      <p>Today I made my first cooking video for this blog. The cooking part of the process didnâ€™t really work out so well, but the video was fun to make and I think it merits being posted because honestly I think it was kinda funny, if I say so myself. Anyway, enjoy my failed attempt at making sea foam candy.</p>
